# Tectone23 Test App

The app has basic login and signup screens, a balance card at the top of the wallet screen, transactions list, make a new transaction screen, and receive money pop.

- The project is configured with mock data.
- Used firebase auth for Email and password signIn/signUp ( i havent saved the userID in the shared preferences or locale cache, so each time you need to make a login before being able to go to home page ).
- Used Cubit for State management [Docs here](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/).
- Implemented Validators for text fields.
- Dependency Injection.
- Firebase auth errors handling.
- App routing using [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router).
- Logging using [Loggy](https://pub.dev/packages/loggy).
